A 20x4 LCD is controlled with an Arduino and a rotary encoder by selecting a menu and pushing the encoder. This simple example uses the rotary library but it doesn’t use a menu library. It also includes a sleep feature for the LCD.

The selected options are saved and can be seen in the “Summary” menu option. Reset option …well …resets the Summary table back to zero.

I hope it helps!
